# The way to make the CRISPY fries

Step 1: Peel the potatoes, or don't if you prefer potato skin.
Step 2: Cut them into fry-like shapes.
*NOTE* - Be sure to get roughly equal thickness, and cut them maybe twice as thick as you want them — they'll shrink a lot during cooking.
Step 3: Boil them until you're afraid they're going to fall apart or for about eight minutes.
Step 4: Gently drain them and lay them on a pan wide enough to hold them all in a single layer.
Step 5: Drizzle on enough oil to thoroughly coat all the pieces.
Step 6: Shake the pan to coat the pieces and get the fries evenly distributed. 
Step 7: Roast at 450ºF. Check on them after 45 minutes.
*NOTE* - Add more oil if they look dry, and move around any pieces that seem to be cooking unevenly.
Step 8: Roast them some more until they're brown and crispy, for another 45 minutes.
*NOTE* - Be careful not to overcook them — very brown will taste burned. And you can pull them when they're still a little floppy, because they will harden as they cool.
Step 9: Place kitchen towel or a couple layers of paper towel in a large bowl, and dump the fries in.
Step 10: Let the towel soak up the excess oil, and then whip it out.
Step 11: Season the fries with coarse salt, pepper, garlic powder, chopped cilantro and grated parmesan and then toss it.
Step 12: Serve hot or/and with any sauce you want.
